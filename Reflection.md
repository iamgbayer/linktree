# Reflection

## AI Tools Usage

My workflow with AI tools is using Cursor autocompletion and Agents to help me write code, give ideas and plan the project.

- Plan: Defining the initial scope, and some possible ways to implement them.
- Code: Autocompletion and Agents, but you need to always iterate and give good prompts to get good results (relying only on AI is dangerous), like checking code quality, project structure, separation of concerns, etc.
- Test: Discussing with the AI about core test cases, and then writing them.

## Future Improvements

- More robust authentication, with email verification, password reset, etc.
- Implement unit tests, but for now e2e are covering the overall layers.
- Rely on data to know if most of users come from mobile or desktop, and act accordingly.
- Discover with product team, which features are most important and focus on them.
- SEO optimizations for the public profile page.
